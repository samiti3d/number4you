<h1>Understanding user levels</h1>

For better security and control of your users there four types of user-levels implemented in CuteNews.
Each user-level has limited permissions in doing specified actions.<br>
The user-levels are as follows:<br>
<ol>
    <li><b>Administrators</b> - administrators are allowed to do anything they want: edit others posts, comments, ban users, edit system configurations and everything else ... so be careful when adding users as administrators!</li>
    <li><b>Editors</b> - the users from this level are allowed to post news, they can edit own posts and the news posted from all other users. They can also approve news which are added by the 'Journalists'</li>
    <li><b>Journalists</b> - this level is for users who only need to post and edit news. They can edit only own posts !. When journalist add's new article it will not be active and instead will be marked as 'Unapproved', In order for this article to become visible admin or editor must approve it.</li>
    <li><b>Commenters</b> and <b>Ban</b> - when users from this level login, they are allowed only to change their passwords. Cannot post, edit news or perform any other action. This is useful when some user wants his username to be password protected when posting comments and no one else to be able to post with his username. You can also deny unregistered users to be able to post comments.</li>
</ol>

In 2.0 you can create more user level groups.
